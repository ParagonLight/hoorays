hoorays for our paper KDD 2017

This is another implimentation for the paper "HoORaYs: High-order Optimization of Rating Distance for Recommender Systems". In this code, we give a demo on MovieLens data.

Although the code is not the version for experiment of the paper, the results are relatively same.

If you want to use this code, please cite our paper:
